# OCR-D Quiver Data

This repository provides the Ground Truth data for the [OCR-D Quiver back end](https://github.com/OCR-D/quiver-back-end.git).
This data serves as a basis for benchmarking the performance and accurac of different OCR-D workflows for different types of input data.

Currently the Ground Truth data has been selected according to the following characteristics:

* century of creation
* fonts used
* layout (simple vs. complex)

Only works that have both layout and text Ground Truth available have been added to the corpus.

In some cases several works have been merged into one "meta" work in order to have more data at hand and to consider heterogeneous material.

A more detailed description of the data can be found in the [corresponding ticket in OCR-D's Zenhub board](https://github.com/OCR-D/zenhub/issues/130).
